# nfalite

nfalite should be one of possible implementations nondeterministic finite automata (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton).

In opposite to finite state machine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine), this implementation of NFA should provide possibility for entity be in more than one state, to (based on previously defined relations and priorities) decide which of active states should be updated.
Also project should support to import states' relations and priorities created by some tools/technologies nativly created for defining relations and properties (soon more about this)

# The project is at an early stage of development.
